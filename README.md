## 🎯 Purpose  
I built this project to get **hands-on experience** with AI agents using [phidata](https://pypi.org/project/phidata/) and [Groq](https://groq.com/), while also integrating real-world tools like YouTube summarization and Google search.

## 🛠️ What’s Inside  

✅ **Phi Agents**  
✅ **Groq model** (`deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b`)  
✅ **YouTube Tools** – for summarizing videos and fetching latest uploads  
✅ **Google Search Agent** – fetches real-time info in English and Tamil  
✅ **Team Agent** – combines both for full video + channel insights

## 🧪 Sample Usage

```python
team_Agents.print_response("Summarize this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp0mT42kepg&list=PL0N0mLMfepi-olljfgwmypvkOq2xtGHZE&index=5 and provide latest information about Department of Computer Science & Engineering channel", markdown=True, stream= True)
```
